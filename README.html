<h1>Alfaerie Omega Chess Variant Image Package v1.2</h1>

<p>This directory contains graphics from the excellent Alfaerie Chess Variant Graphics 
set, plus expansion sets. The goal is to include all known Alfaerie chess graphics
into one, flat archive. Instead of having separate downloads to add new images,
a new version of this package can be released when there are new images. Contributions
are welcome! Note that I didn't make most of these images, I'm merely collecting and
organizing them.


<p>Sets included here:

</ul>

<p><strong>For an auto-generated list of the 800+ available blue and white pieces, see the <a href="master.html">master list</a>. For all images, see the <a href=".">index</a></strong>.

<p>In general, images are named beginning with b or w, for blue or white, followed by a descriptive name for the
piece. In some cases, g, r, or k prefixes are seen for green, red, or black. However, the blue pieces are intended to be
used for the black pieces in chess. Only transparent gif images are included here, not Windows bitmaps.

<h2>Change Log</h2>
<p>v2.0 (2011/02/26; 800 pieces) is a major revision, breaking backwards-compatibility
<ul>
<li>Added new pieces by Christa Connelly: blowfish, dog, dolphin, duck, flamingo, and witch
<li>Added other new pieces: bronotosaurus, rat, mouse, fieldmouse, sidewinder, daemon, turtle, bison, buffalo, and many other variations
<li>Added a total of 44 new pieces
<li>Added a piece image wishlist (contributions welcome!)
<li>Added index.jsonp as an alternative to loading index.json using Ajax
<li>Added several informational tags to various pieces in index.json, and its keys are now sorted
<li>Added a compact view to browse.html 
<li>master.html now displays pieces much more compactly, two-dimensionally instead of linearly
<li>process_images.py is now compatible with Python 2.6
<li>Consistency: the snipers forwardknightbackwardsprince and forwardrookbackwardsprince have been renamed to fknightbprince and frookbprince 
<li>Consistency: pieces digit0 through digit9 have been added, replacing 0-9.gif (edigit0-9.gif are the closest to the originals)
<li>Consistency: caged pieces now confirm to the color prefix convention (bc?bishop is now ?cbbishop, etc.)
<li>Consistency: the cage piece is now a solid color, instead of solid black
<li>Removed rotated image generation by default, it produced too many files and is best handled within the app instead (but you can re-enable it in process_images.py if needed)
<li>Removed black (k*.gif) pieces, too ugly (again, generation can be re-enabled in process_images.py if you miss these)
<li>Removed highpriest_ess, which was identical to highpriestess2
</ul>

<p>v1.5 (2010/11/10; 756 pieces) has a bunch of improvements, notably:
<ul> 
<li>incorporated Alfaerie Expansion Sets <a href="sets/alfaerie5a.html">5</a> and <a href="sets/alfaerie6.html">6</a>
<li>added a handful of pieces with missing colors (smallcircle, forfnibakking, furlrurlbakking, wwall, ewall)
<li>a new JSON <a href="index.json">piece index file</a> with metadata about each piece (issue <a href="https://github.com/shellreef/alfaerieomega/issues/closed#issue/6">#6</a>)
<li>generated rotated versions (45&deg;, 90&deg;, 135&deg; clockwise/counterclockwise, and inverted) of every piece in an optional package (issue <a href="https://github.com/shellreef/alfaerieomega/issues/closed#issue/3">#3</a>)
<li>generated yellow, red, green, cyan, orange, pink, and grey versions of every piece (issue <a href="https://github.com/shellreef/alfaerieomega/issues/closed#issue/1">#1</a>)
<li>Python script <a href="process_images.py">process_images.py</a> for generating 
<a href="list.txt">list.txt</a>/<a href="master.html">master.html</a> (supersedes the Perl script),
    updating <a href="index.json">index.json</a>, and generating colored/rotated variants

<li>an experimental Ajax-based <a href="browse.html">piece browser</a> for searching pieces by name or tag
</ul>

<p>v1.2 (2010/11/04; 699 pieces) adds 20 new and exclusive piece images ("<a href="sets/alfaeriebeta.html">Alfaerie Beta</a>"), 
    and is the first public release, <a href="https://github.com/shellreef/alfaerieomega">now available on GitHub</a>.

<p>v1.1 (2009/06/13; 679 pieces) renamed the filenames to be all lowercase, and use an underscore instead of a dash. Only affected a few alfaeriemisc images, mostly from Shogi. This change allows the piece filenames (minus extension) to easily be used as identifiers in many programming languages.

<p>v1.0 (2009/06/12; 679 pieces) contained the original alfaerie set, expansion sets 1 to 4, alfaerie plus, and alfaerie misc, 
in a flat directory structure, with HTML files referencing each file. If you only want the original images,
this is the version for you.
